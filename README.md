# Retrieval-Based Chatbot

## About The Project
This project is about building a retrieval-based chatbot using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models. The chatbot will take input from the user and generate a response based on the most relevant response from a pre-defined set of responses.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a collection of question-answer datasets from the University of Tehran students.

## Approach
The project will use a machine learning approach to recognize the user intent and retrieve an answer. The following steps will be taken:
- Data Preparation: The dataset will be preprocessed and cleaned to remove any noise and irrelevant information.
- Training: Train 3 models with ann, LSTM, and BERT.
- Model Evaluation: The model will be evaluated on a test set to measure its accuracy and other performance metrics.

## Requirements
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- HuggingFace Transformers library
- BERT
